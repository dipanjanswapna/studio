## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated red (#FF4747), suggesting energy and action, is ideal for attracting attention to key interactive elements. In RGB, it is equivalent to text-red-500 and bg-red-500 in Tailwind.
- Background color: Light gray (#f6f6f6), nearly white. Its lightness avoids distracting from the interface while still differentiating the various regions of the display. In RGB, this is equivalent to bg-gray-100 in Tailwind.
- Accent color: Very dark gray (#242424) for text elements that need to have very high contrast in the light color scheme. It also brings a sense of sophistication and precision. In RGB, this is equivalent to text-gray-900 in Tailwind.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for UI and titles.
- Font weights: 400 (Regular), 500 (Medium), 600 (Semi-bold), 700 (Bold).
- Modern, flat design icons in primary red.
- Responsive design with adaptive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Subtle animations and transitions for a smooth user experience.
